# Bits & Bytes Lexicon

Welcome to the Bits & Bytes Lexicon! 🚀

"Words that I came along while learning stuff."

This repository is a collection of computer engineering terminology that I've encountered while learning and exploring the fascinating world of technology. From algorithms to data structures, from programming languages to hardware components, this lexicon aims to compile and organize essential terms to aid in learning and reference.

Feel free to explore the repository and use it as a handy resource in your journey through the realms of computer engineering. If you come across any terms that you'd like to add or improve, contributions are always welcome!

Happy learning! 🖥️💡

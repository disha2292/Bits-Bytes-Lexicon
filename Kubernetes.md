Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

## declarative configurations :
In the declarative approach, developers specify a desired state and let the configuration management tool determine how best to achieve it. In other words, declarative tools rely on the developer to specify what to do, whereas imperative tools rely on the developer to specify how to do it.

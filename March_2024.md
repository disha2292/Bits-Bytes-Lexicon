## Command Line Interface :
CLI stands for Command Line Interface. It's a text-based interface used for interacting with a computer program or operating system by typing commands into a terminal or command prompt. In contrast to graphical user interfaces (GUI), which rely on visual elements like windows, buttons, and menus, CLI relies solely on text input and output.

In a CLI environment, users can navigate the file system, execute programs, configure settings, and perform various tasks by entering commands and parameters. CLI is commonly used by developers, system administrators, and power users for its efficiency, flexibility, and scripting capabilities.

Examples of CLI interfaces include the Windows Command Prompt, Unix/Linux shell (such as Bash), macOS Terminal, and various programming language shells like Python's interactive interpreter.

## RSS reader
An RSS reader, also known as an RSS aggregator or feed reader, is a software application or web service that allows users to subscribe to and read content from multiple websites or blogs in a centralized location.

RSS (Rich Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication) is a technology used by websites to publish frequently updated content, such as blog posts, news articles, podcasts, and videos, in a standardized format. RSS readers enable users to subscribe to these RSS feeds and receive updates whenever new content is published, eliminating the need to visit each website individually.

RSS readers typically organize subscribed feeds into a customizable interface, displaying headlines or summaries of recent posts. Users can then click on individual items to read the full content within the RSS reader itself or navigate to the original website.

Some RSS readers are standalone desktop or mobile applications, while others are web-based services accessible through a browser. Popular examples of RSS readers include Feedly, Inoreader, and NewsBlur.

Overall, RSS readers provide a convenient way for users to stay informed about their favorite websites and topics by aggregating content from across the web into a single location.
